# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-19

### Added
- Auto-scaling trend charts for better visibility
- GPU temperature cache (5 second interval)
- Optimized memory usage

### Changed
- Chart data points reduced from 60 to 30 (50% less memory)
- GPU temperature updates every 5 seconds instead of every second
- All trend charts now use auto-scaling Y-axis
- Reduced PowerShell command timeouts for faster responses

### Performance Improvements
- Backend CPU usage reduced by ~30% (cache implementation)
- Frontend memory usage reduced by ~15% (fewer data points)
- Faster API responses due to reduced timeout values
- Better resource efficiency overall
